Requirements for climb:
- Hold position
- Encoder Counts (to ensure what length the arms are at)(possible 0 component to reset encoder counts)
- PID controls
- current (voltage) threshold to make sure the motors dont burn out 

Other information:
- 3 775 motors 
- First arm = hoist 1
- Second arm = hoist 2 
- Third arm = hoist 3
- Gear ratio 40:1
