/*Code outline to implement playing back a macro recorded in BTMacroRecord
*Be sure to read out of the same file created in BTMacroRecord
*BEWARE OF: setting your motors in a different order than in BTMacroRecord and changing motor values before
*time is up. Both issues are dealt with and explained below. Also only read/write from/to the motors 
*you have fully coded for, otherwise your code will cut out for no reason. 
*In main, the try/catch structure catches any IOExceptions or FileNotFoundExceptions. Necessary to play back
*the recorded routine during autonomous
