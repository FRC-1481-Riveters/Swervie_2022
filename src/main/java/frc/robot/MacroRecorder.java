/*
*This macro records all the movements you make in teleop and saves them to the file you specify.
*make sure you record every variable you need, if you dont record the value from a motor or a solenoid,
*you won't be able to play it back. It records it in "frames" that contain a value for each output 
* you want to use during teleop
*BE AWARE: write into the same file as you do in the Play macro
*BE AWARE: Only write/read the motors/other things that you actually have fully created in 
*your code. Otherwise you'll lose robot code randomly with no reason
*In main, the try/catch structure catches any IOExceptions or FileNotFoundExceptions. Necessary to play back
*the recorded routine during autonomous
